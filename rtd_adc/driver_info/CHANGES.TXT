Linux Software (DM35424)

v01.00.00 (rev A)   6/26/2013  RGG
-----------------------------------
- Initial version


v02.00.00 (rev B)   7/20/2015  RGG
-----------------------------------
- Updated example programs to handle passing 16-bit DAC values to library
  instead of 32-bit values for the conversion functions.
- Added open function to temperature library
- Minor change to how driver allocates memory for DMA.
- ADC and DAC Interrupt Enable was not being returned correctly from the
  library function call.
- The convenience functions to convert counts to volts and volts to counts now
  takes the set input/output range as a parameter instead of channel.  This removes
  a hidden structure that kept that information.  
- Driver is now dual-licensed.  The driver and all files required to use it
  is GPLv2 licensed, and the user-mode libraries and examples use the
  standard RTD license.
- Driver now creates the device files directly, instead of having the user
  do so via the /proc.  This is in response to the /proc interface changing
  in kernel version 3.10.
- "Board" library functions and references changed to "Gbc" because that
  is where they actually are.  
  
  
v03.00.00 (rev C)   3/20/2016  RGG
-----------------------------------
- Explicitly calling pci_set_master in driver to allow DMA, as some
  UEFI BIOS do not set this in PCI space.
- Removed library function _Find_Used_Buffer because it had some inherent flaws
  and in very remote cases could fail.  The user is now responsible to keep
  track of what buffer is next.  All examples using DMA have been updated to
  demonstrate how to do this.
- Changed method in library for setting sample/conversion rate.  It now gets the 
  system clock from another library call (which constrains it) instead of reading
  it directly.  This solves a problem where consecutive calls to set the same
  sample rate was resulting in different rates for different function blocks.
- Removed library function for setting ISR priority.  Using it required being root,
  and it's not actually needed anyway.


v04.00.00 (rev D)    03/17/2017     RGG
---------------------------------------
- Added revision info from GBC registers to list_fb example output.
- DMA Buffer setup library call changed.  It now takes a single unsigned
  8-bit value for the register instead of booleans for every bit.
- Dma Initialize and other functions moved out of DMA library and into 
  os-specific library.
- Added reference count to driver.  This prevents the device file from being
  opened while already held open by another program.
- All instances of CLK_SRC_GBL have been changed to CLK_BUS for clarity.
- Removed setting rate in _dac example, as it is not needed.
- Removed --adc option from ADC examples, as it did not provide much help
  to the user, and prevented example compatibility between 224 and 424 boards.
- Added --bin2txt option for ADC DMA example, to convert binary file to ASCII

  
v04.00.01 (rev E)   03/03/2020  LRF
-----------------------------------
- Added support for the 5.0 Kernel Version. Repalced depricated SUBDIRS with
the modern M=
- Added support for 5.1 kernel version DMA. Sets a Device struct to track DMA
allocated memory, which is now required.
- Kernel version 5.6 requries the use of ioremap(...) since ioremap_nocache(...)
s now deprecated and subsumed by the former.
- Fixed an error with some versions of Linux for accepting input on the DM35424_ref_adjust(...)
