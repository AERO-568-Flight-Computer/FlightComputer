Make sure driver is loaded on the flight computer

Open terminal and use command:

lsmod 

to check which drivers are running

Driver name is "rtd_dm35424"

If it is not there, use command:

sudo insmod /home/cp-opa/Desktop/DM35424_Linux_v04.00.01/driver/rtd_dm35424.Known

This will reload the driver to the system. Check if it is loaded with lsmod
